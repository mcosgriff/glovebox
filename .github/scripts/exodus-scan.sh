# Scans an APK with Exodus Privacy's tracker scanner (exodus-standalone) and fails if it finds a
# tracker, or if the APK's permissions differ from .github/privacy/permissions.txt (#217).
#
#   .github/scripts/exodus-scan.sh <apk> <out-dir>
#
# Writes <out-dir>/exodus.json (the scanner's report) and <out-dir>/exodus-summary.md (a few lines
# for release notes). The container sees a copy of the APK and nothing else of the checkout.
#
# The scanner matches the APK's code against Exodus's list of known tracker signatures, which it
# fetches when it runs. It finds libraries, not behaviour: "0 trackers" is what it can say, not
# that the app sends nothing.
#
# The image is pinned by digest, as the workflows pin actions by commit. To upgrade, pick a tag
# from https://hub.docker.com/r/exodusprivacy/exodus-standalone/tags and pin its index digest
# (`docker buildx imagetools inspect exodusprivacy/exodus-standalone:<tag>`).
# A false positive is ignored by the tracker's Exodus id: add `-i <id>` below, with a comment saying why.
